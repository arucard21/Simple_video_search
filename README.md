# Simple Video Search
A simple system that allows searching for videos from the Youtube-8M dataset based on their similarity to a provided video. 

## Usage
The classification part of the system requires 2 additional directories to be available, the dataset (for validation purposes) and the training model. These should be made available in the root of the git directory and named `dataset` and `logistic-model` respectively.
